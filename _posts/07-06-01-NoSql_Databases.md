## Introduction to NoSQL Databases
{#databases_nosql_title}

NoSQL databases provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. They are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL databases are generally categorized under four types:

1. **Document Databases**: Store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Example: MongoDB.
2. **Key-Value Stores**: Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs. Example: Redis.
3. **Column-Oriented Databases**: Data is stored in columns instead of rows. Example: Apache Cassandra.
4. **Graph Databases**: Store data in graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties. Example: Neo4j.

MongoDB being the leading NoSQL database can work

## Why NoSQL?

- **Flexibility**: NoSQL databases often use flexible data models, allowing for more rapid changes and iterations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers.
- **Performance**: Optimized for specific data models and access patterns, often resulting in faster queries.
